“Tim Kreider’s writing is heartbreaking, brutal and hilarious—usually at the same time. He can do in a few pages what I need several hours of screen time and tens of millions to accomplish. And he does it better. Come to think of it, I’d rather not do a blurb. I am beginning to feel bad about myself.”

– Judd Apatow

This post might change your life.

It contains a short audio essay titled “Lazy: A Manifesto.”  I plan on listening to it every Monday morning.

We Learn Nothing by Tim Kreider, a dazzling collection of humor and insight, is the newest book in the Tim Ferriss Book Club. I loved this book so much that I reached out to Tim and we produced the audiobook together. “Lazy: A Manifesto” is one small chapter.

If you want to stop feeling rushed, this might be the medicine you need.

If you want to burst into hysterical laughter in airports and freak out everyone (as I did), look no further.If you want to say “That’s exactly how I feel, but I’ve never had the words to express it!” this book delivers.  There’s a chapter for everyone.

Click here to download the brand-new audiobook of We Learn Nothing.

Here is the sample essay, “Lazy: A Manifesto” (right-click here to download, or stream below):

#68: Lazy: A Manifesto (15 Min)
00:00 / 00:00

More on Tim from a Pulitzer Prize winner:

“Tim Kreider may be the most subversive soul in America and his subversions—by turns public and intimate, political and cultural—are just what our weary, mixed-up nation needs. The essays in We Learn Nothing are for anybody who believes it’s high time for some answers, damn it.”

– Richard Russo, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Empire Falls

Of course, Tim is a phenomenal cartoonist, and I wouldn’t want you to miss the artwork, so I pow-wowed with his agent, who kindly provided a ton of his cartoons for sharing with you. You can download a treasure trove (about 150MB) by clicking here.

Enjoy! Don’t miss this one.

Hi Tim

Been doing the diet first outlined in 4HB. and I haven’t lost any abdominal fat even though I was vigilant. Although I’ve not been awesome about drinking water so that might be it.

Will the ab exercises you describe help target the ab fat?

And secondly, if I do the occams protocol with machine weights is it better to ALSO add in the kettlebell swings or is that overkill.

Thanks so much for all your hard work

Hey!

Not tim but you might eat “too much”. The slowcard diet is good because it gives you what you need and usually makes you eat less than you need. But not always. If I were you I would count how many calories you consume and cut down a bit and see if it helps. And no ab exercises will do nothing about the ab fat. You will loose that fat though your diet.

Some feedback on the “Lazy: A Manifesto” audio and your podcasts: I love it when you open with “Hello, ladies and germs.” It’s so unselfconscious–like you’re not worried you might like a 5th grader. I look forward every time to hearing you say that and am disappointed when you don’t. It’s like Walter Cronkite signing off his newscasts with, “And that’s the way it is . . . .”

Thanks for the post Tim and turning us on to this dude Tim Kreider. This was a good reminder of my own addiction to busyness. Gawd I think I answered “How are you?” with “super busy” just about every day this week. *gag*

I think it’s helpful to locate this concept of busyness in a developmental context. My favorite one describes those “busy” people as having a core value system consisting of “ambition, personal success, and achievement” whereas those who have made the shift out of busyness have a core value system consisting of “sensitivity, community and contribution.”

Shifting value systems is harder than simply deciding “I’m not going to be busy anymore.” This article about Spiral Dynamics further elucidates these concepts:

Lazy is the first book I have ever returned in my life. Got to chapter 10 and decided to stop abusing myself and not help the book profit. Have read most of what Tim Ferriss has recommended over the years (including his own books) and always consider each a 101% win kind of book. Have to recommend “total recall arnold schwarzenegger book” for something totally rocking.

Lazy is just the rantings of a rather mean spirited guy with an Allegiance to the extreme Left who is cruel about it and towards other views. I don’t have an allegiance to the left or right, I prefer to think for myself… and don’t like zealots on either side that with “intellectual banter” try to demonize people they don’t agree with. Even a superficial study of history shows where dehumanizing people leads, and this guy could be a goebbels for the extreme left. Just isn’t kind, and the scope of his narrative is shallow. He also just seems like an EMO loser that drinks and cry-holes his way through life.

Feel free to flame me and say “you don’t get it”. You may well be right, I don’t get it. This book is like a WTF for me coming as a recommendation from Tim Ferriss. The 99% of everything else Tim Ferriss has written and recommended has made my life much more kick-ass and wonderful.

I just cannot help but wonder, does “Lazy” equal the political views of Tim Ferriss? That for me would be sad, I would expect more.

I felt the same. The chapter in the podcast was awesome but the book made me feel horrible about life. I’m all for being open to divergent viewpoints and believe that society benefits from balance, but after buying the full book I’m seriously going to do more homework the next time Tim adds a book to the club. I’ve got every book he ever wrote and love them. Loved The Obstacle is the Way. But this book left me feeling hopeless which is not what I ever get out of reading anything related to Tim Ferriss. Definitely a WTF moment for me as well. I found all of the qualifiers in the introduction to the Glen Beck interview interesting being that there were no such similar qualifiers in the introduction to the book in the podcast, a book that Tim published himself. I’m all for challenging assumptions but this book just seemed to confirm my worst fears. I’ll remain resolute in working to appreciate the need for balance and diverse viewpoints but not to the point of needing to appreciate the kind of pent up anger expressed in this book.

Call him a loser is the same as saying that you did not understand the book. The pont he is making is againsy the mainstream mind set of Society. There is no losers or winners, life is not a game, life is life. The book is not a naivee cheap self help book, therefore is not for someone that is not interested in analyzing life the way it is.

Loved this quote:

“It’s hard to find anything to say about life without immersing yourself in the world, but it’s also just about impossible to figure out what that might be, or how best to say it without getting the hell out of it again.”

I feel like this all the time, and one thing I never regret is spending time in nature whether it be alone or with friends. Always come back feeling recharged.

I’m gonna check out the full book.

Thanks Tims. (Kreider and Ferriss)

I started listening to this just after I had bailed on my friends to stay late at work, and boy did the message hit me like a ton of bricks. I think what is great about listening to your podcast and reading your books, is that I gain tools that help me to optimize (and minimize) my time at work so I can be more lazy. Thankfully, my staying late on Thursday was, in part, because we had a guy quit last week and I am having to step up until we hire someone else, then I can go back to being lazy.

Sure, one solution to having a meaningless job is to quit and spend the rest of your life playing games. You might have fun, and that’s nice. Alternatively, you could get a real job, and actually challenge yourself to make a difference. It’s not the system that makes you the way you are, it’s your choices, and they are entirely your own responsibility. Rather than feeling proud of yourself for being clever enough to do nothing all afternoon, go out and actually DO something. BE the person solving the malaria crisis, BE the person resuscitating a cardiac arrest, BE the person rebuilding homes after a storm. Get some skills! It’s harder than drinking cocktails, but I guarantee it’s more fulfilling.

I understand the role of someone like Mr. Kreider but I’m not particularly in the mood for intellectual petulance. I’m more in the Arnold Schwarzenegger / Tony Robbins zone at the moment.

Incidentally, if I was drinking at a bar with Mr. Kreider in NYC (and I’ll make the safe assumption he’s from the city), I probably would get up and leave. Or drink more.

Daniel can perform incredible maths in his head. He learned to speak icelandic fluently in 3 days and sees numbers as textures and colours. He has Savant Syndrome and I would love if you could try to arrange an interview with him for your show? Keep up the good work.

Have to comment because I really didn’t like this. Within 30 seconds I could tell that Kreider is a person of a certain privilege, with work flexibility and clearly not scrambling for money. Also seems like he doesn’t have kids.

I’m a doctor and mother to 2 little kids. I am way too busy and I don’t like it. I tell people I’m busy not to boast, but because I think it sounds better than saying I’m exhausted all the time. I genuinely have too much to do and too little time. It doesn’t help that our work culture in the US expects white collar professionals to work 50-60 hours a week. I have a friend who took an academic medical job in North Carolina, and unlike most universities they were clear: full time is 55 hours per week. Which is a bit crazy, they expect five 12 hour days or that you should routinely work on weekends. She has two little kids and makes it happen but I’ve refused to go that route. (I’m still busy all the time though!)

I’m sure Kreider is right that there is a group of childless people who make themselves busier than they have to be. And yes, many kids are overscheduled, and many parents overdo their parenting. But for many of us, we are very busy because work, financial pressures, and/or family pressures are real and considerable.

That’s not to say that we can’t find ways to reduce the stress and busy feeling in our lives, but listening to Kreider is not the way to go. (Unless the rest of the book is WAY better, which it might be.) Much better to try Zen Habits, which is written by a father and seems more sensitive to what many of us face.

Listened to the book on my way up to Wisconsin this past weekend. Coincidentally, I had just finished the chapter on political allegiance right before going to a bar and watching the Final 4 NCAA games. It was fun to see Kreider’s observations become reality and after 30 minutes of pondering these observations, I promptly remembered the chapter on living well and spending time with friends and did just that the rest of the game. Thanks for the recommendation.

This is definitely true. People complain about how busy they are with their everyday activities that they don’t have time to do some personal stuff like traveling, attending small parties or even just walking at the park. But the truth of the matter is, it’s them who chose to be busy. Ironic.

One of the most profound observations of the current state of people’s lives in 2015, at least in the USA. Mindless Zombies is how I see them on an endless race track of avoidance of actually living and enjoying life. It’s easy to fall into the trap. “Plan shopping” is a practice I see again and again among the same folks. This is in my opinion one of the greatest impediments to restoring your health both mentally and physically as it keeps you from exploring what is possible and locks you into the conventional. Great recommendation Tim!

Geez, there are so many parts of this essay that I love… It resonated so much to me. I’m not sure if it’s because I listened to it a day before leaving for a much needed trip to Mexico after a super long and hectic winter or if it was because everything Kreider talked about is what I see every day in life. There is so much truth here. Why do we boast that we are so busy all the time? I agree with Kreider that it some existential reassurance that what we do is important and to protect ourselves from the emptiness inside when all the noise is removed. Most of us are afraid of being alone with ourselves but if you do indeed sit with yourself on a regular basis (through meditation etc…) you realize that the quiet core of your being is where you find your most inspiring thoughts and most beautiful connections. The busyness and noise in life takes you further and further away from being able to tap into the space where true genesis happens. And you know what, it’s hard! I’m a co-founder of a tech start up that is re-inventing the email experience and it’s not always the easiest thing to be idle or give myself the time and quietness that I know is needed. Most of us are striving to find a balance between work, family, friends, and all other obligations. And that’s all we can do is try…to be present, be aware, and find the place between sloth and work mania where the magic happens.

P.S. LOVE the podcast. Keep up the great work!

Can’t wait to read this! Currently dousing my copy of The Four Hour Work Week (FHWW) in red ink and highlighter, but this is going on the list! I have, and honestly am, a chronic sloth. And I believe the reason for that has been in part due to the absence of a goal worth chasing (something I learned in FHWW.) But as Tim K says, perhaps its this privileged position outside of the beehive that has given me a unique perspective. It sounds like he and I share some values and I can’t wait to read more! Thanks for the recommendation Tim F!
