Hi Tim,

Have you considered making transcripts for these? Perhaps after the fact if you want to initially encourage podcast listenership.

I‚Äôm a huge fan, have read most of your stuff. And I hate, hate, hate listening to audio/video, because I can read the same thing 5-6 times faster.

I‚Äôve listened to a few podcasts, and liked them, but overall I‚Äôve just sort of checked out because I don‚Äôt do audio. This is abnormal for the internet overall, but I bet a sizeable chunk of your audience 1. really likes you and 2. also hates audio. Preferring reading is very common in the tech niche.

If you made transcripts I would probably read every single podcast, and also listen to the ones that seemed particularly interesting. And share them of course.

Graeme

p.s. Not sure if I ever thanked you anywhere else, but thank you for the 4HWW. Changed my life, literally. I dropped out of law school and ended up making an online LSAT prep business. I help make it cheaper for others to study for the LSAT and apply to law school.

Following the 4HWW, I set things up so everything I do is remote and largely non-time sensitive. I can sleep in when I feel like it, check out for a week if I want, travel etc. I went to Brazil for five weeks in Nov/Dec to learn portuguese. And on the flip side, when I feel like it I can instead spend 60 hours a week working to create a new product I‚Äôm proud of and that will earn me the recurring money I need to continue my adventures.

Thank you so very, very much.

Graeme I can‚Äôt agree that everyone preferring reading. Someone sitting at work and can not browse web pages so he can use headphones to listen to the recordings.

The very best way is to public audio, transcripts and video with subtitles. Why video with subtitles? It‚Äôs easiest way to understand for someone non-speaking english very well just like me.

But make all of them is lot of work. So I dont grumble. Just be thankfull for each useful and motivation information.

If you‚Äôre comment is in response to the suggestion to offer a transcript I would offer the following: A suggestion or request doesn‚Äôt always equal a complaint. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that people are inherently dissatisfied- they are just sharing with Tim another way of offering the information that would be useful to them. A few weeks ago Tim did a transcript and I loved it and shared with him how much it was appreciated. Many lifestyles, my own included, lend themselves better to reading than listening. Does Tim have to oblige us? No. Does it hurt to let him know some of his followers would like the information that way? No. Does that mean we appreciate his efforts less. No. Hope this helps us understand each other better. Have a great day!

I know, right? How dare people have different needs, tastes, preferences. Why can‚Äôt everyone just take what they‚Äôre given and be happy about it? The nerve‚Ä¶ /eyeroll

Folks are just offering some constructive feedback. I‚Äôm sure Tim appreciates hearing from his audience what works for them and what doesn‚Äôt. The fact is he won‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a percentage of people he‚Äôs not reaching due to the audio-only format unless they speak up. Nobody is whining or complaining about it. Nobody is saying they feel entitled to non-audio options. But they *are* letting him know there‚Äôs an audience out here craving transcripts if he‚Äôs interested in pursuing it.

+1 for transcripts

Tim Ferriss
APRIL 15, 2015 AT 2:51 AM

Just to jump in here.

I definitely appreciate everyone playing nice. I like feedback and suggestions. I can‚Äôt implement all suggestions, but they are appreciated.

Transcripts are very time-consuming to do right, and crappy transcripts make me angry, so I‚Äôve opted not to include. Many of the top podcasts don‚Äôt even include show notes and related links, keep in mind. I just have to keep this fun and lightweight for me, so there are sadly trade-offs.

Hope to have transcripts sometime soon, but it‚Äôs currently too much of a headache. I‚Äôll keep mulling on options.

If people have suggestions for good transcription companies (NOT your own), I‚Äôm all ears! So far, they are mediocre at best, and the editing takes just as much time as doing it ourselves.

Thank you for all the comments,

Tim

Can‚Äôt reply to Tim‚Äôs comment below, so I‚Äôm replying here. I wasn‚Äôt complaining that Tim *should* do XYZ; I was just describing my use case so Tim can adapt, if he wants to.

Tim, very reasonable point below about transcript quality + complexity of the project. No sense getting X% more reach if it makes the whole thing complex enough that it‚Äôs no longer fun.

I thought back to two podcasts I‚Äôve read transcripts of that were good. You may already know these companies.

This is Patrick Mckenzie‚Äôs podcast: http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-getting-your-first-consulting-client/

He uses Casting words. However, he says ‚ÄúI always use them for transcription and then make a hand-pass to make things flow a bit better and format for the Internet.‚Äù. The requirement to do a hand pass likely makes it not worthwhile.

Secondly, I‚Äôve enjoyed Mixergy‚Äôs transcripts. I googled and found they were done by this company: https://www.speechpad.com/buzz

Hope that‚Äôs of use. And I‚Äôve really enjoyed the podcasts I‚Äôve listened to; I listen when there‚Äôs someone I‚Äôm very interested to hear. I now have a lifttime countdown clock on Chrome thanks to Kevin Kelly.

Hey Tim,

Great podcasts, especially loved the one with Arnold.

I‚Äôve been using Speechpad and it‚Äôs been a lifesaver. They‚Äôll miss a word here or there (a lot of the time it‚Äôs a similar sounding word that makes no sense in context but your brain will likely skip over it), but overall very high quality and easy to use. You just upload the file and they get to work right away. It‚Äôs $1/minute for one week turnaround, but they do rush jobs as well. I use it all the time on Make More Marbles. I give them specific instructions on structure and headlining so it comes out more like a blog post and less like a blob of text. Worth a look.

Best,

B

Thanks for sharing Rolf‚Äôs essays on this subject. Exploring the world with my family is something that really calls to me as a curious man and a father.

The passage that really resonated with me was about how vagabonding forces you to get right with yourself before you can achieve it. That you can make good on your financial and emotional debts so you can discover yourself through travel, rather than escape yourself. (Paraphrasing).

One regret I have about my youth was not learning earlier the weight of making commitments. Over promising leaves one heavy with financial and emotional burdens that make it very difficult to experience such a life. That said‚Ä¶ To hear testimonials that encourage people like me that simply making the choice to travel, and beginning to make choices that move me toward it, already put me on the path, is wholly up lifting. Thank you, Tim.

Excellent. Read Vagabonding and the 4HWW and it‚Äôs become central to the way I percieve and go about things. Earning your freedom is as difficult as breaking from the common thinking and can, in my case take a couple of years. I dumped the biz in Southampton NY, moved to TX where it never snows and plan on spending a couple of months in Europe this summer/fall. Took two years from beginning to now.

APRIL 11, 2015 AT 8:06 AM

The 4HWW was what got me motivated initially to start looking for the freedom to live my life the way I want and it also showed me what‚Äôs even possible. It has been quite some time since I‚Äôve read it but now it seems I‚Äôm finally getting closer to achieving freedom.

On another note, have you read Eckhart Tolle‚Äôs books Tim? You should check out The Power of Now if you haven‚Äôt yet, especially since you‚Äôve been talking about mindfulness and stuff. I‚Äôve finally read it a while ago and it has really changed the way I see everything. We are the ones who create the suffering and pain for ourselves and being present is the key to everything.

Anyways, just found it interesting since I haven‚Äôt heard you mention him yet.

Cheers

Tolle is interesting. But a lot of his stuff is just rehashed Buddhist philosophy. He can make for a good introduction to the subject, much like reconstituted deli meat might be a good introduction to turkey. If you want to explore a little more, I‚Äôd recommend the book Compass of Zen by Seung Sahn. You‚Äôll see what I mean about Tolle. He‚Äôs not a bad writer or a fraud or anything, but he doesn‚Äôt really bring any original ideas (other than the vague new age metaphysical type of thing ‚Äì vibrations etc. ‚Äì which sometimes is misrepresented as literal rather than metaphorical). Reading Tolle is better than nothing, but (imo) he is still just another ‚Äòguru‚Äô primarily trying to sell books/seminars/etc.

Reply
Andreas
APRIL 12, 2015 AT 5:44 AM

Interesting. You make it sound like you need anything else than what he teaches. Can you give me an example of what else there is that could be useful that he left out?

The good thing about Tolle‚Äôs work is that he simplified everything and left out all the spiritual voodoo stuff. I never bothered with any spiritual stuff anyway and Tolle‚Äôs stuff is pretty much all practical.

Have you read his stuff? He mentions all kinds of religions and philosophies but only the stuff that relates to what he talks about. There is no philosophy in his books, his stuff is not something you have to believe in. Again it‚Äôs all practical stuff and to me so far most of what I‚Äôve heard from him makes very much sense, and I‚Äôm a rational guy.

I am hard of hearing and I am lucky that I can for the most part hear the podcasts. I can see both sides of the equation for Tim here. Podcasts do a better job of capturing the emotion, excitement, and feelings of the moment. Transcripts convey the information but don‚Äôt really give you any impact. Sort of like reading a script doesn‚Äôt really bring it to life. Closed captioning and subtitles work because the action is happening behind it. I personally use it because I don‚Äôt like missing everything and you pick up stuff in the background that is often hilarious.

That being said, I went to Rochester Institute of Technology where there are about 1200 deaf people at any given time on a campus of 15,000 students. All efforts to make everything inclusive for all the deaf and hard of hearing students were made including note taking for most classes (uploaded online), sign language interpreters upon request, real time captioning for events, and C-Print. C-Print was RIT‚Äôs choice for transcribing lectures where powerpoint wasn‚Äôt being used a tool for teaching. Both loved and hated C-Print because it helped me pick up stuff I missed but I couldn‚Äôt look at equations or pictures the professor was referencing. But this took the dedicated resources of a transcriber for however long the class was.

All that being said, I still believe that if Tim were able to find a good way to transcribe entire podcasts and manage cost, time, and resources effectively (4 Hour Work Week!) it would be incredible. I believe podcast transcrption would certainly be an added benefit to the blog as it opens a new audience (readers, deaf people, grey hairs) and accentuates the blog . A transcribed podcast would certainly be something I would pay for since I‚Äôm saving time and can focus on absorbing the information. I‚Äôd like to see this personally because I focus my energy on trying to pay attention to whats being said in the podcast rather than processing what is being said (Alot of deaf people rely on ASL interpreters to understand what is going on. Note taking allowed the students to pay attention to the interpreters without having to worry about missing the lecture notes).

This value-add was in reference to your 4/15 comment about so far only having experience with mediocre transcription companies for turning audio into written content (a common request of your podcast listeners). The gift is from my friend and provider for this service Janette from Success Transcripts, whom I asked if she‚Äôd provide the service for free as a chance to earn your business. Janette is wonderful at what she and her team do, with many IM, speaker and author clients that rely on her 10-year old company for high-quality transcription services within short time frames and at a reasonable cost (including some with whom we‚Äôve both shared the stage).

A debt of gratitude is in order for another extraordinary podcast, an auspicious indication of why I quit my employment and venture to the far corners of the planet on a bike. The connection to Vimeo on interest just shows two of the four motion pictures you prescribe: ‚ÄòUniverse of Tomorrow‚Äô and ‚ÄòAwakening‚Äô, Which I anticipate watching, notwithstanding, despite everything i‚Äôm left hanging for the secret film!!!!! Kindly do share..
